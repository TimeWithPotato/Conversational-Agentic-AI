# ðŸ¤– Conversational Agentic AI for Job Interviews

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project aims to develop a **voice-to-voice conversational AI system** that simulates job interviews. The system uses **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** and **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to deliver intelligent, personalized responses based on data extracted from a candidateâ€™s CV. The user interacts with the system using voice, and the AI responds with voice as well, enabling a seamless and natural interview experience.

## ðŸ§  Key Features
- **Voice Input & Output**: Converts spoken questions to text and generates spoken responses.
- **Context-Aware Responses**: Combines general LLM reasoning with personalized retrieval from a vectorized CV database.
- **RAG Pipeline**: Uses document chunking, vector embedding, and semantic search for relevant CV data.
- **LLM Integration**: Enhances the conversational AI's ability to reason and respond intelligently.
- **Custom CV Dataset**: Candidates' CVs are parsed, structured, and used as knowledge base for answering questions.
